# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application simulating a booking platform like Airbnb. It focuses on building a scalable backend with robust database design, secure APIs, and efficient deployment pipelines. The project aims to enhance skills in collaborative development, modern frameworks, and industry-standard practices.

## Goals
- Master backend development using Django and GraphQL.
- Design a relational database with MySQL or PostgreSQL.
- Implement secure APIs with authentication and authorization.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- Collaborate effectively using GitHub workflows.

## Tech Stack
- **Django**: Backend framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL**: Relational database for storing user and booking data.
- **GraphQL**: Query language for efficient API communication.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD tool for automated testing and deployment.




## Team Roles

The Airbnb Clone Project involves multiple roles to ensure successful development and deployment. Below are the key roles and their responsibilities:

- **Backend Developer**: Designs and implements server-side logic, APIs, and database integrations using Django and GraphQL. Ensures the application is scalable and performs efficiently.
- **Database Administrator**: Plans and manages the relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL), defining schemas, optimizing queries, and ensuring data integrity.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Sets up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Docker, automates testing and deployment, and maintains infrastructure reliability.
- **Security Specialist**: Implements API security measures like authentication, authorization, and rate limiting to protect user data and transactions.
- **Project Manager**: Oversees project progress, coordinates team tasks, and ensures timely delivery while maintaining alignment with project goals.
