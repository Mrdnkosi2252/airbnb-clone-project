- **Project Manager**: Oversees project progress, coordinates team tasks, and ensures timely delivery while maintaining alignment with project goals.




# Technology Stack

The Airbnb Clone Project leverages modern tools and frameworks to build a scalable booking platform. Below are the key technologies and their purposes:

- **Django**: A Python-based web framework used to develop RESTful APIs and handle server-side logic for user management, bookings, and properties.
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database system for storing and managing data related to users, properties, bookings, and payments.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs, enabling efficient data retrieval and reducing over-fetching compared to REST.
- **Docker**: A containerization platform ensuring consistent development and deployment environments across team members.
- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD tool for automating testing, linting, and deployment workflows to streamline development.




## Database Design

The Airbnb Clone Project uses a relational database to manage core entities. Below are the key entities, their fields, and relationships:

- **Users**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each user.
  - `email`: User’s email address for login.
  - `password`: Hashed password for authentication.
  - `name`: Full name.
  - `phone`: Contact number.
  - **Relationships**: A user can own multiple properties and bookings; a booking belongs to one user.

- **Properties**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each property.
  - `title`: Property name or description.
  - `owner_id`: Foreign key referencing `Users`.
  - `location`: Address or coordinates.
  - `price_per_night`: Cost per night.
  - **Relationships**: A property belongs to one user; a property can have to multiple bookings.

- **Bookings**:
  - `booking_id`: Unique identifier.
  - `id`: Unique ID for each booking.
  - `property_id`: Foreign key referencing `Properties`.
  - `user_id`: Foreign key referencing `Users`.
  - `check_in`: Check-in date.
  - `check_out`: Check-out date.
  - **Relationships**: A booking is linked to one user and one property.

- **Reviews**:
  - `id`: `: Unique identifier.
  - `user_id`: Foreign key referencing `Users`.
  - `property_id`: Foreign key referencing `Properties`.
  - `rating`: Numerical rating (1–5).
  - `comment`: Text comment.
  - **Relationships**: A review is linked to one user and one property.

- **Payments**:
  - `id`: `: Unique identifier.
  - `booking_id`: Foreign key referencing `Bookings`.
  - `amount`: Payment amount.
  - `status`: Payment status (e.g., pending, completed).
  - `date`: Transaction date.
  - **Relationships**: A payment is linked to one booking.

**Entity Relationships**:
- A user can have multiple properties and bookings.
- A property can have multiple bookings and reviews.
- A booking belongs to one user and one property.
- A review belongs to one user and one property.
- A payment is associated with one booking.








## Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone Project includes core features to replicate a booking platform’s user experience and business logic. Below are the main features:

- **User Management**: Allows users to register, log in, and update their profiles. Supports secure authentication to protect user data. Critical for personalizing user interactions with the platform.
- **Property Management**: Enables property owners to list, edit, and manage their properties. Provides search and filter options for guests to find suitable accommodations. Drives the core listing functionality.
- **Booking System**: Facilitates booking requests, availability checks, and cancellations for properties. Ensures seamless transactions between guests and hosts. Central to the platform’s operational flow.
- **Review System**: Allows users to leave ratings and feedback for properties after their stay. Enhances trust and informs future bookings. Improves user decision-making.
- **Payment System**: Processes secure payments for bookings with support for multiple payment methods. Ensures financial transactions are safe and reliable. Essential for monetization.



## API Security

Securing the Airbnb Clone Project’s APIs is vital to protect user data and ensure trust. Below are the key security measures:

- **Authentication**: Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to verify user identity for API requests. Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive endpoints like user profiles or payment Ensures data access only by legitimate users.
- **Authorization**: Restricts access to resources based on user roles (e.g., guest, host, admin). Ensures users can only perform only perform authorized actions, like hosts editing their own properties. Protects against misuse of the system.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of API requests per user to prevent abuse or denial-of-service attacks. Maintains server performance and availability. Enhances system reliability during high traffic.
- **Data Encryption**: Employs HTTPS and TLS to encrypt data in transit, safeguarding sensitive information like payment details. Crucial for protecting user privacy and complying with regulations.

These measures collectively ensure the platform’s data integrity, user privacy, and secure transactions.




## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the development, testing, and deployment processes for the Airbnb Clone Project. They ensure code quality, reduce manual errors, and enable rapid delivery of features.

- **Why CI/CD?**: CI/CD pipelines allow developers to test to integrate code changes frequently, running automated tests to catch bugs early. They also streamline deployment to production, ensuring consistency across environments. This improves development efficiency and reliability.
- **Tools Used**:
  - **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows for linting, unit testing, and integration testing on every push or pull request.
  - **Docker**: Packages the application and its dependencies into containers for consistent testing and deployment across environments.

These tools enhance collaboration and ensure the application remains stable and scalable.
