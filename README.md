# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application simulating a booking platform like Airbnb. It aims to develop a scalable backend using Django, PostgreSQL, and GraphQL, with secure APIs and automated CI/CD pipelines. The project enhances skills in collaborative development, database design, and industry-standard practices.

## Project Goals
- Build a robust backend with Django and GraphQL for efficient API communication.
- Design a relational PostgreSQL database for users, properties, and bookings.
- Implement secure APIs with authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.
- Automate testing and deployment using CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.
- Foster collaboration via GitHub workflows and team roles.

## Team Roles
The project involves key roles to ensure successful development, aligned with industry standards:

- **Backend Developer**: Implements server-side logic, RESTful APIs, and GraphQL queries using Django.
- **Database Administrator**: Designs and optimizes PostgreSQL schemas for data integrity and performance.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Configures CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Docker for automated testing and deployment.
- **Security Specialist**: Ensures API security through JWT authentication, role-based authorization, and rate limiting.
- **Project Manager**: Coordinates tasks, tracks progress, and aligns deliverables with project goals.

## Tech Stack
- **Django**: Backend framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL**: Relational database for storing user and booking data.
- **GraphQL**: Query language for efficient API communication.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD tool for automated testing and deployment.
